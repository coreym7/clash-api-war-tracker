## 2. üêç Install Python

This project requires **Python 3.8 or higher**.

### üì• Download Python:

## 3. üìÇ Create Your `.env` File

Inside the project folder:

1. Locate the `.env.example` file
2. Make a copy and rename it to `.env`
3. Open the new `.env` file and fill in the values:

```env
API_TOKEN=your_token_here      # Get from https://developer.clashofclans.com/#/

## 4. üì¶ Install Required Python Packages

Use the provided `requirements.txt` to install dependencies.

Open a **Command Prompt** in the project folder and run:

```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `pip` isn't recognized, you may need to restart your command prompt or run `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` instead.

## 5. üõ†Ô∏è Create the Local Database

Before running the main script, initialize the SQLite database:

```cmd
python src/create_db.py
```

This creates a `clash_tracker.db` file in the project root.

---

## 6. ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Project

To fetch data and populate the database:

```cmd
python main.py
```

This will:
- Pull your clan's current roster and war data from the Clash API
- Save the data into your local database
- Optionally, generate a report depending on how `main.py` is configured

---

## ‚úÖ You're Done!

Check the `data/` folder for downloaded API data and `reports/` for output files.
